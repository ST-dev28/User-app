# User list app

## Task

### User story

Client asked us to develop a Users list app where:
-  users are fetched from source API and beautifully rendered in app list. 
-  List should be paginated (API is adapted to return paginated results) and  have "Previous" and "Next" buttons at the bottom of the list. 
-  App design should be responsive and compatible with mobile/tablet/desktop devices screen sizes.

## Technical Requirements

- App should be built with React library
- App should use test https://reqres.in/ API
- App design should be created with plain CSS/SCSS.
- Solution's source code should be provided in a GIT repository

### Requirements

- App should fetch data from test API and render user data results in user list
- User list should be paginated
- App should have responsive design
- Add, edit, delete user buttons should be created. Add the user button should be placed at the top of the list and open the user add form. Edit and delete user buttons should be located in the list, in each user data block. Edit button should open user edit form, and delete button - remove user from list and source. Test API requests should also be used in these functionalities when forms are submitted/user deleted
- There are no strict rules for list design so feel free to improvise and use your imagination/creativity. However, the application should look visually good

## Nice to have requirements (optional)
- E2E tests

### Expected application usage
1. User runs application in web browser
2. Application fetches data from test API
3. Application renders data results in users list 

## Additional information
It is not mandatory to provide a fully working solution - part of it can be enough. Emphasize on quality over quantity.
